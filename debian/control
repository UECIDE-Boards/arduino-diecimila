Description: Arduino Diecimila or Duemilanove w/ ATmega168
 The Arduino Diecimila is a microcontroller board based on the
 ATmega168. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of
 which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz
 crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP
 header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to
 support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer
 with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery
 to get started.
 .
 "Diecimila" means 10,000 in Italian and was named thusly to mark
 the fact that over 10,000 Arduino boards have been made.
